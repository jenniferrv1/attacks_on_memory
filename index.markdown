This site aims to document the attacks on memorial sites and their members or representatives which honor the victims of the violence that occurred in Peru from 1980 to 2000, particularly in the cities of Lima and Ayacucho. I trace these attacks from 2007 to 2025. Over the years, the severity of the attacks has increased. As successive governments have shifted further to the far-right or ultra-right, these memorials have faced growing hostility due to their content and the memories of the victims they represent. This trend highlights a pattern of censorship and increasingly aggressive strategies used by the ultra-right to control which memories are acknowledged and discussed. The perpetrators of these attacks, the majority of which are Congresspeople, are attempting to reshape the narrative to align with the perspective of the victors while downplaying the experiences of Indigenous groups and communities that suffered during this period of violence.
